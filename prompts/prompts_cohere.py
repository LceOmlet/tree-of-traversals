up-to-date answers. Your task is to interface with the knowledge graph in order to answer the above query. \
You will be able to expand the knowledge graph until you have found the answer. Think in detail before acting or answering.\

Formmating rule & available actions:
'THINK' - Generate relevant thoughts to solving the problem. This could include recalling well known facts from memory.
\te.g.
\t\tTHINK: I should search for the movies directed by...
\t\tTHINK: I know that Biden is American, therefore...
\t\tTHINK: I see that John Cena is in both The Independent and Vacation Friends, therefore...
'EXPAND_KG' - Search for edges of entities in the knowledge graph using an external API. This is a useful function for getting to the correct answer.
\te.g. EXPAND_KG: I should search for the country of origin of Jonathon Taylor
'ANSWER' - Generate the final answer once the problem is solved. Just state the best answer, do not output a full sentence.
\te.g. 
\t\tANSWER: No
\t\tANSWER: Harry Potter
\t\tANSWER: [Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger]

Please strictly and directly prompt out the results formated as the **formmating rule** describes after thinking like the above listed results.
If you are not certain/sure for something or find your self repeat too much, please make simple reflection to end the task.
